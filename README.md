This repository contains Processor-FPGA transfer rate measurements in CycloneV-SoC.

All numeric values for the paper *"Design Guidelines for Efficient Processor-FPGA Communication in FPSoC Devices"* are available in the file *"CycloneVSoC\_all\_measurements.xlsx"*. 
 
If the paper becomes accepted all time measurement programs will be uploaded into this repository.

As clarification, the following figure shows the different data paths used in the experiments.
