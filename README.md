CycloneVSoC-time-measurements
=======================

This repository contains Processor-FPGA transfer rate measurements in CycloneV-SoC.

All numeric values for the paper *"Design Guidelines for Efficient Processor-FPGA Communication in FPSoC Devices"* are available in the file *"CycloneVSoC\_all\_measurements.xlsx"*. 
 
If the paper bocomes accepted all time measurement programs will be uploaded into this repository.

The following lines in this README file contain an explanation of the experiments and a summary of the most important  numeric values for easy consult in from the web.
