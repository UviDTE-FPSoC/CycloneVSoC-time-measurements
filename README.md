CycloneVSoC-time-measurements
=======================

This repository contains Processor-FPGA transfer rate measurements in CycloneV-SoC.

All numeric values for the paper *"Design Guidelines for Efficient Processor-FPGA Communication in FPSoC Devices"* are available in the file *"CycloneVSoC\_all\_measurements.xlsx"*. 
 
If the paper becomes accepted all time measurement programs will be uploaded into this repository.

In order to serve as clarification, the following figure shows the different data paths used in the experiments.
