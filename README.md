CycloneVSoC-time-measurements
=============================

This repository contains Processor-FPGA transfer rate measurements in CycloneV-SoC.

All numeric values for the paper "Design Guidelines for Efficient Processor-FPGA Communication in FPSoC Devices" are available in the file "CycloneVSoC_all_measurements.xlsx". 
 
If the paper bocomes accepted all time measurement programs will be uploaded into this repository.

The following lines in this README file contain an explanation of the experiments and a summary of the results for easy consult in from the web.
